The Getting Started project is a simple GitHub repository which contains everything you need to build an image and run it as a container.
Clone the repository by running Git in a container.
You can also type the command directly in a command line interface.

docker run --name repo alpine/git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started.git
docker cp repo:/git/getting-started/ .
